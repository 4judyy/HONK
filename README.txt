# User Guide for Gameplay
First the user must enter a username and password, including their level of permissions (Student, Teacher, Developer).
If they are an existing user, they will be logged back into their saved account. If not, their username will be added to the database,
creating a new user. When logged into the game, the user can explore the map and click on the mini-games created. For a tutorial, we created
a how-to page for new users to learn how our games are played.
The users progress is tracked as they play the game and push their way onto the leaderboard.
When they are finished playing, they can exit the game as their data will be saved onto their account for the next time they want to play.

# Teacher Mode
To access teacher mode, we included a dropdown menu inside the login for users to select the level of permissions they have. When inside Teacher
mode, they can access the score tracking and search for other users individually, providing them with their total score, and their level in each
mini-game.
